        before voting opens.
        \item All candidates standing for election must take part in the hustings.
        \item Candidates for President must prepare a 3-minute campaign video to played at the

        \end{itemize}
        \item Each prosper must give a one-minute speech followed by the candidate giving a two minute speech.
        \item Each candidate must sing a song, perform a poem or tell a joke. This may be done with their proposer and/or seconder. This will be followed by campaign videos for Presidential candidates.
        \item Each candidate may ask one question; followed by questions from incumbents, Executive Officers, and then any other members.
        \item All candidates may respond to questions addressed at individual candidates.
        \item After questions, Presidential candidates may make a final concise statement.
    \end{itemize}

        \item A voting station may be set up and monitored by the Election Officers during the voting period.
        \item A member must not reveal how another member has voted.
        \item At the end of the voting period, the Election Officers will count the votes.
        \item The results will be announced on the stairs outside the bar. They should also be announced via an email to members and a post in the college Facebook group.
