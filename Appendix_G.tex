    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The priority of undergraduate students in any College room allocation process will be categorised as follows, in descending order or priority:
        \begin{enumerate}[i.]
            \item Students determined by College to be exempt from the room ballot on grounds of health, personal issues or immigration status.
            \item Students returning from a year abroad.
            \item Students returning from a concessionary year out.
            \item Students holding a JCR position that guarantees a room in college, as defined in the JCR Standing Orders.
            \item Students who have lived out of college for at least two years of their undergraduate degree.
            \item Students who have lived out of college for one year and have lived in college for no more than one year of their undergraduate degree.
            \item Students who have lived out of college for one year and have lived in college for two or more years of their undergraduate degree.
            \item All other students.
        \end{enumerate}

        \item Students will be allocated a room in college based on the priority of their category above.

        \item If, during the allocation process, the number of students in a category exceeds the number of remaining rooms, all students in that category will be entered into a random ballot to determine which students will be allocated a room.

        \item The College Officers reserve the right to exclude any student from the room ballot, based on the College Handbook.
    \end{enumerate}
