# Van Mildert College JCR Standing Orders
This repository contains LaTeX sources of the Standing Orders of Van Mildert College Junior Common Room.

Compiled PDFs can be found on the [JCR website](https://mildert.co.uk/constitution).

## Amendments
All changes to the Standing Orders must be approved by the JCR as specified in the Permanent Standing Orders.

Suggested amendments should be submitted to Governance Committee.

## Editing
You can use a text editor or LaTeX editor. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is recommended as it does not require any new software to be installed and allows the compiled PDF to be displayed side-by-side with the source. Overleaf also has useful guides to writing with LaTeX.

If you prefer to edit on your own computer, it is recommended that you use [latexmk](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html) to compile the PDFs.
